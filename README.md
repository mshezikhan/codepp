# 📘 Code++ — Programmer’s Notebook

**Code++** is a lightweight, open-source, offline notebook built specifically for programmers and students.  
It focuses on helping you **remember, organize, and reuse** programming knowledge — without cloud accounts, clutter, or distractions.

## 🎯 The Mission

Most note apps are generic and not built for how programmers actually work.

Code++ is built to do **one job well**:  
Help programmers store and quickly recall **syntax, commands, setups, workflows, and daily handy coding knowledge**.

It is designed as a **developer-focused, offline-first, and student-friendly tool**.
